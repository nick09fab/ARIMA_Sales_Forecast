ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
The acronym of ARIMA stands for [1]:
AutoRegressive = the model takes advantage of the connection between a predefined number of lagged observations and the current one.
Integrated = differencing between raw observations (eg. subtracting observations at different time steps).
Moving Average = the model takes advantage of the relationship between the residual error and the observations.
The ARIMA model makes use of three main parameters (p,d,q). These are:
p = number of lag observations.
d = the degree of differencing.
q = the size of the moving average window.
